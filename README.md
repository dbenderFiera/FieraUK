Fiera Real Estate UK Github repository

This repo is intended for open sharing of codebooks and data related to data science initiatives within Fiera Real Estate, particularly for the UK division.

We will be adding codebooks and datasets here, with a focus on location analysis, data science and machine learning, and visualisations to support our teams both in the UK and globally. Feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate, contact info below.
